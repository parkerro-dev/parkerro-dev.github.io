# Intensity of Interference Patterns (two-source)

We assume that the two sources have equal amplitude E and the same polarization. This assumes that the two sources are identical.

## Electric Field Amplitude
From (INSERT LINK TO WAVE AND OPTICS 2 INTENSITY OF A SINUSIODAL WAVE) each source by itself would give an intensity of $\frac{1}{2} \epsilon _{0}cE ^{2}$ , at a point P. 

If the two sources are in phase, then the waves that arrive at P differ in phase by an amount $\phi$ that is proportional to the difference in their path lengths $(r _{2} - r _{1})$. Then we can use these expressions for the two E fields superposed at P. $$E _{1}(t)=E\cos(\omega t+ \phi)$$$$E _{2}(t)=E\cos \omega t$$ So we find that the electric field amplitude in two-source interference is: $$E _{p} = 2E|\cos \frac{\phi}{2}|$$ where $\phi$ is the phase difference between the waves.


## Intensity in Two-Source interference:
To obtain the intensity I at a point P, remember that I is equal to the average magnitude of the Poynting vector, $S _{av}$.

So the intensity in a two source interference is: $$I = I _{0}\cos ^{2} \frac{\phi}{2}$$

## Phase difference and Path difference:
The phase difference $\phi$ between two fields at any point P from two sources: $$\phi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}(r _{2}-r _{1}) = k(r _{2} - r _{1})$$
where k is the wave number.
