# Fourier Series

**Definition:** A function $f : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is piecewise continuous if $[a, b]$ can be divided into a finite number of subintervals on the interiors of which $f$ is continuous and has finite left hand and right hand limits at all the endpoints of these subintervals.

<u>Easy langauge</u>: A function $f$ is piecewise continuous if it doesn't have infinitely many pieces.

**Definition:** $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is periodic if there exists some T $\neq$ 0 such that $f(x+t)=f(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The smallest T that exists for a function is called its period.

**Definition:** $f$ is even if $f(x)=f(-x)$ for all x, and $f$ is odd if $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all x

**Theorem:** IF $f$ is even then $\int \limits ^{a} _{-a}f(x)dx =2 \int\limits_{0}^{a}f(x)dx$ and if $f$ is odd then $\int\limits_{-a}^{a}f(x)dx = 0$

Theres a bunch of stuff about defining the vector space $C _{p}$ which allows us to have a vector space where you can have an infinite amount of vector components.

There are screenshots below:
