# Diffraction
Light can bend around corners, and it is called diffraction.

### Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction:
According to geometric optics, when an opaque object is placed between a point light sources and a screen, the shadow forms a perfect sharp line. This is not true, and it is because of light's wave nature. This is called diffraction. There are two types:
- Fresnel Diffraction (near field diffraction where the screen is close)
- Fraunhofer Diffraction (far field diffraction where the screen is far away)
