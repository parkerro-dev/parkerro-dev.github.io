## Nature of light:


Light is an Electromagnetic wave. It is also a particle.

This is know as the wave-particle duality of light. The particle aspect is mainly concerned with emission and absorption, it shows that energy carried by light is packaged in discrete bundles called __photons__ or __quanta__. 

The propagation of light is best described by a Wave model, but emission and absorption require a particle approach. It is important to consider [[Wave Fronts]]  and [[Rays]] when describing lights propagation.

##### Sources of light
All objects release [[Thermal Radiation]], which is a form of electromagnetic radiation. At high T, these objects can produce its own light.

Light is also produced by electrical discharges through ionized gases.

In most sources, light is emitted independently by different atoms within the source. Whereas in a [[Laser]], atoms are induced to emit light in a cooperative, coherent fashion. (This allows it to be monochromatic).

Light travels at c, c = 2.99792458 x $10^{8}$ m/s.

##### Characteristic of light
- [[Reflection and Refraction]]
- [[Polarization]]
