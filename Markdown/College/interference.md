# Interference

Interference refers to any situation where two or more waves overlap in space, it is governed by the Principle of superposition. 

Interference is the whole premise behind the:
- [[Two Slit Experiment]]
- [[Thin Film Interference]]

### Types of Interference:

#### Constructive Interference:
When waves from two or more sources arrive at a point **in** phase, they reinforce each other. If they are completely in-phase, then the amplitude of the resultant wave is the sum of the individual waves.

#### Destructive Interference:
When waves from two or more sources arrive at a point 180$^{o}$ **out of phase**. They destructive act on each other. The resultant wave's amplitude is the difference of the waves.

Interference patterns are <u>NOT</u> standing waves.
> In standing waves, there is no net energy flow in either direction.
> in interference patterns, there is a flow of energy outwards from the two sources.
