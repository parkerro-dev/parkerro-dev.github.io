#### For electromagnetic waves:
Polarizing filters for electromagnetic waves have different details of construction based on the wavelength. This note talks about the concept of a polarizing filter, where as [[Application of Polarizing Filters]] discusses there uses and calculations! Intensity is calculated with [[Malus' Law]]

(this is in the frame of a microwave)
**A good polarizer is an array of closely spaced, parallel conducting wires that are insulated from each other.** 
Electrons move freely along the length of the conducting wires, and will do in response to a wave whose $\vec{E}$ field is parallel to the wires. The resulting currents in the wire dissipate to heat. The dissipated energy comes from the wave, so whatever wave does pass through the grid is greatly reduced in amplitude.

Waves with $\vec{E}$ oriented perpendicularly to the wires pass through almost unaffected since the electrons cannot move through the air between the wires, hence such a wave that pass through a filter like that will be predominantly polarized in the direction perpendicular to the wires.

#### Polaroid:
The most common polarizer for visible light is a material known by the trade name **Polaroid**, widely used in sunglass and for camera. This material has substances that have **dichroism**: a selective absorption, in which one of the polarized components is absorbed much more strongly than another.

A Polaroid transmits 80% of more of the intensity of a wave that is polarized parallel to the polarizing axis, but only 1% or less of the waves that are perpendicular.

(note: one type of polaroid uses long chain molecules which are oriented with their axis perpendicular to the polarizing axis, and they will absorb light along their length (same idea as the wires)).
