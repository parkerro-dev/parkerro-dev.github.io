# Wave Intensity
the time average rate at which energy is transported by the wave, per unit area, accross a surface perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

Measured in W/$\text{m}^{2}$ because it is an average poer per unit area.

Usually described by:
$$I_{1} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^{2} _{1}}$$
This is the intensity at a certain radius from the source. If no energy is absorbed between one radii and another the P must be the same for both so: $$4\pi r^{2} _{1}I_{1} = 4\pi r^{2} _{2}I_{2}$$Then we can derive the Inverse-square law for intensity:
$$\frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}} = \frac{r^{2} _{2}}{r^{2} _{1}} $$
