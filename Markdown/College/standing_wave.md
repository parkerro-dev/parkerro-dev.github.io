# Standing waves:
#college/physics/Waves
Standing waves occur when both ends of a string are fixed. The wave will be reflected from the other fixed side.

This creates nodes and antinodes.

Wave Function of a standing wave is given by:
$$y(x,t) = (A_{SW}\sin(kx))sin\omega t$$
The standing wave amplitude $A_{SW}$ is 2A.

The standing wave carries equal amount of power in both directions.

### Nodes and Antinodes:
The wave has nodes at both ends of the string. Adjacent nodes are one half-Wavelength apart, so the length of the string must be: $\frac{\lambda}{2}$, $2 \frac{\lambda}{2}$, and so on.
- $\text{L} = n \frac{\lambda}{2}$ for n = 1,2,3, ..
- $\lambda _{n} = \frac{2L}{n}$ for n  1,2,3, ...

The smallest frequency is for the largest wavelength. The more nodes there are the larger the frequency. The fundamental frequency is the smallest frequency ($f_{1}$).

$$f_{n} = n \frac{\nu}{2L} = n f_{1}$$ These frequencies are called harmonics and the series is called the harmonic series. The overtones start at the second harmonic.

You can sub $\nu$ out for the speed of transverse wave in Mechanical Wave.
