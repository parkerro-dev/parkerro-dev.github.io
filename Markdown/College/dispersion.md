Ordinary white light is a superposition of waves with all visible wavelengths. All the waves at the c, but the speed of light in a material depends on the refractive index, and is different for different wavelengths.

**Therefore the index of refraction of a material actually depends on the wavelength.**

This is called dispersion.
