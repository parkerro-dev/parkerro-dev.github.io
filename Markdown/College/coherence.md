# Coherent Waves
#college/physics/Light 

In physics, two Wave sources are coherent if their frequency and [[Wave Function|waveform]] are identical. Coherence is an ideal property of waves that enables stationary interference.

More generally, coherence describes all properties of the correlation between physical quantities of a single wave(young's slit) or between several wave or wave packets.
