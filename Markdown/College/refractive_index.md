# Refractive index
#college/physics/Light  

Light always travels more slowly in a material than in vacuum.

The refractive index (n) is then calculated as a ratio of the speeds of light in vacuum vs the material. $$n = \frac{c}{\nu}$$
#### Connecting refractive index to wavelength:
What happens to the other characteristics of light as it passes into a different medium (this are the characteristics of a Wave). The frequency does not change, which means that the wavelength must change (due to $\nu=\lambda f$)$$\text{Wavelength of light in a material: } \lambda = \frac{\lambda_{0}}{n}$$
where $\lambda_{0}$ is the wavelength of the light in a vacuum.

With the consideration of different wavelengths moving slower we have [[Dispersion|dispersion]]
