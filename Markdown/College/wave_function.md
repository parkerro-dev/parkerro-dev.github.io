### Wave function of a sinusoidal wave:
A sinusoidal wave  travelling in the positive-x direction has the wave function: $$ y(x,t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t)$$
where k is the __wave numer__, $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$, and t is time.

In the case that the wave is travelling in the negative-x dirction the wave function is: $$ y(x,t) = A\cos(kx + \omega t)$$
For either of the waves the $(kx \pm \omega t)$ represents the phase.

#### Particle velocity and acceleration in a sinusoidal wave:
From the equations above we can get the "transverse velocity" particle in a transverse wave. We will call this speed $\nu _{y} \text{ to distinguish from } \nu$ 
for wave speed. $$ \nu _{y} = \frac{\delta y(x, t)}{\delta t} = \omega A \sin(kx - \omega t)$$
The accelation of any partical is the second partial derivative of t:$$ a _{y} = \frac{\delta ^{2} y(x, t)}{\delta t^{2}} = -\omega^{2} A \cos(kx - \omega t) = -\omega ^{2}y(x,t)$$
This brings us on to the wave equation.

(Extra: The first partial wrt to x is the slope and the second is the curvature).
