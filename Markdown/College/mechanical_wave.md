Travel through mediums.

A **wave pulse** is a disturbance that moves through a medium.

A traverse wave is one whos displacements are perpendicular to the direction travelled by the wave. i.e

Transverse mechanical waves can either be traveling or [[Standing wave]].

A longitudinal wave is one whos displacements are parallel to the direction travelled by the wave, i.e

Every element of the medium is oscillating.

Only the disturbance is traverse (in transverse wave) the flow of the wave is still going "forward".

### Speed of a transverse wave on a string:
The speed of a transverse wave on a string is affected by the medium which it travels through (i.e the string). We have to define a mass per unit length ($\mu$) and a tension (F). $$\nu = \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}$$

### Speed of any mechanical wave:
It turns out that the transverse wave speed is actually not special.
	$$\mu = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Restoring force returning the system to equilibrium}}{\text{Inertia resisting the return to equilibrium}}}$$

### Average Power of a sinusoidal wave on a string:
$$P_{av} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\mu F}\omega^{2}A^{2}$$
