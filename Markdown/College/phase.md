# Phase:
#college/physics/Waves
The phase of a wave with the Wave Function :$$ y(x,t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t)$$
is the component inside cosine term: $(kx \pm \omega t)$ 

It is an angular quantity (measured in [[radians]]) and its calue for any values of x and t determines what part of the sinusoidal cycle is occuring at a particular point and time.

Phase velocity = $\nu$ of the wave.
