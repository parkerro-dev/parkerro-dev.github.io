>[!Example]
> Ex. 1:
> Solve the initial value problem:
> $y'' + y' -2y = 0$, $y(0) = 4, y'(0) = -5$
> Characteristic equations is $\lambda ^{2} + \lambda - 2 = 0$ with roots 1 and -2
> General solution is $y = c _{1} e ^{x} + c _{2} e ^{-2x}$. The initial conditions imply that  $c _{1} + c _{2} = 4$ and $c _{1} -2 c _{2} = -5$
> Hence $c _{1} = 1$ and $c _{2} = 3$ and the solution $y = e ^{x} + 3e ^{-2x}$
