The functionality of this website is built with the React Framework using React-Router for naviation, and ChakraUI for styling.

The project posts are rendered with React-Markdown, using remark and rehype plugins for Tex rendering (like this $\frac{\textrm{because markdown}}{\textrm{cannot do this}}$ by itself).
