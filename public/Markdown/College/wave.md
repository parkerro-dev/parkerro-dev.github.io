# Waves

### What is a wave?
A wave is a disturbance from equilbirum that travels, or propagates, from one region of space to another. 

### Two types of waves:
-[[Mechanical Wave]]
-[[Electromagnetic wave]]

### Properties of waves:
- [[Wavelength]]
- [[Coherence]]

A [[Wave Function]] describes the motion of the wave. A [[Wave Equation]] is the most primary mathematical description of a wave.

A [[Periodic wave]] is one who's motion repeats itself over and over. i.e something that is period has a period P and F(x) = F(x+P).

Waves travel at a speed named __wave speed__. It is the speed with which you have to travel to keep alongside a point of a given [[Phase]], such as a particular crest

Waves have a certain [[Wave Intensity]] which is the _the time average rate at which energy is transported by the wave, per unit area, accross a surface perpendicular to the direction of propagation._

## Interference
Waves can interfere with each other when they meet.
- If a trough meets a crest that would negate the Amplitude (Destructive)
- If a crest meets a crest that would increase the Amplitude (Constructive)

If either one of these happen it brings about the [[Principle of superposition]].
