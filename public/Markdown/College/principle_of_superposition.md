## Generally:
**Definition**: States that every charge in space creates an electricc field at point independent of the presence of othre charges in that medium. The resultant electric ffield is a vector sum of the electric field is due to individual charges.


### For Waves:
If two waves overlao the actual displacement at any point on the string at any time is obtained by adding the displacement the point would have if only wave 1 was present and the displacement if only wave 2 was present.
Mathematically: $$y(x, t) = y_{1}(x, t) + y_{2}(x,t)$$
