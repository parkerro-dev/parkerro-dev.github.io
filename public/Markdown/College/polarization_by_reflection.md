Unpolarized light can be polarized either partially or totally by reflection.

There is one incident angle where the light for which $\vec{E}$ lies on the plane of incidence is refracted, $\theta _{p}$, this is called the polarizing angle or Brewster's angle. At this angle the light for which $\vec{E}$ is perpendicular to the plane of incidence is partially reflected and partially refracted. The reflected light is then completely polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence. $$\text{Brewster's Angle}: \tan \theta _{p} = \frac{n _{b}}{n _{a}}$$
