# Classification of Solids
#college/chemistry/inorganic

#### [[Degree of order]]:
- Long range order: Crystals (3D periodicity)
- Long range order with extended defects (dislocations)
- Crystals with disorder of partial structure (ionic conductors)
- Amorphous solids, glasses (short range order)
#### Chemical bonding - typical properties:
- Covalent solids: extreme hardness
- Ionic solids: ionic conductivity
- Metals: high conductivity at low T
#### Structure and Symmetry:
- Packing of atoms: close packed structure
- Characteristic symmetry cubic, hexagonal, centrosymmetric
