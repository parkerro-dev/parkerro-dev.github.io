# Periodic Waves
### Characteristic 
Periodic <ins>transverse waves</ins> follow [[Simple Harmonic Motion]] and have:
- Amplitude = A
- Frequency = f
- Angular frequency: $$ \omega = 2 \pi f$$
- Period (T) = $$ \frac{1}{f} \text{ or } \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$ 
When amplitude is maximum it is called a crest, and when it is minimum it is called a trough.

Periodic waves can also be called __sinusoidal waves__ as any periodic waves can be represent as a sumation of sinusiodal waves.

__Wave Speed of Period Waves__
$$\nu = \lambda f$$ Where it v is actuall a greek letter called "nu". And $\lambda$ is wavelength.
