**Definition**: A characteristic curve of the differential equation is a curve in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ whose tangent vector at each point (x, y, z) on the curve is (a(x, y), b(x, y), c(x, y)) if:
	$$\sigma: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}$$
	$$s \rightarrow (x(s), y(s), z(s))$$
is a characteristic curve, then $\frac{dx}{ds}=a(x(s),y(s))$, $\frac{dy}{ds}=b(x(s),y(s))$, $\frac{dz}{ds}=c(x(s),y(s),z(s))$.

If we take initial conditions $x(s _{0})=x _{0}$, $y(s _{0})=y _{0}$, $z(s _{0})=z _{0}$, then $\sigma (s _{0}) = (x _{0}, y _{0}, z _{0})$ .
Then this system of three ordinary differential equations has a unique solution X(s), Y(s), Z(s).
If we have a solution of the equation u(x, y) we have a characteristic curve. We show that these curves lie in S and so is the union of these curves.
