# Thin Film Interference

When we see bright bands of colour when light reflects from a thin layer of oil on water or soap bubbles, this is thin film interference. ![[Pasted image 20220411121015.png|300]]

### Thin film interference and phase shifts during reflection:
We will use a simplified example where only monochromatic light is used. The set-up is as follows: ![[Pasted image 20220411121304.png]]
Reflections also occur at the top and bottom of both plates, but we won't consider them in this example. The *path difference* between the two waves is just twice the thickness (t) of the air wedge at each point.

One of the waves undergoes a half-cycle phase (180$^{o}$) shift during its reflection. There is a <u>dark fringe where the plates meet</u>. This can be derived from: $$E _{r} = \frac{n _{a}-n _{b}}{n _{a}+ n _{b}}E _{i}$$
This shows that the incident and reflected Amplitudes have the same sign when $n _{a}$ is larger than $n _{b}$ and opposite signs when $n _{b}$ is larger. **When the amplitude is negative it means that a half cycle phase shift has occurred**.![[Pasted image 20220411122919.png]]
#### Mathematically:
If no half-cycle phase shift has occurred (i.e. top reflected) 

Constructive interference:
$$2t = m \lambda \text{ where m}=0, \pm 1, \pm2,...$$
Destructive interference: $$2t = (m+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$$

If a half cycle phase shift has occurred, the two are switched around.

Constructive interference:
$$2t = (m+\frac{1}{2})\lambda \text{ where m}=0, \pm 1, \pm2,... $$
Destructive interference: $$2t = m\lambda$$

##### Why just thin film, why not thick?
Because the light must be coherent to interfere with a definite and constant phase relationship. If light reflects from the two surfaces of a thin film, the two relfect waves are part of the same burst. Hence they are coherent and interference occurs but if the film is two thick then the waves are in separate bursts and are no longer coherent.
