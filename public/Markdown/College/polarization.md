# Polarization
#college/physics/Light  

Polarization is a characteristic of all transverse waves.

### Basic concepts:
For a string that's in equilibrium lies along the x-axis the displacements may be along the y-axis, in this case the string always lies in the xy-plane.
(the string would lie in the xz-plane if the displacements were in the z axis).

When a wave only has y-displacements, it is __linearly polarized__ in the y-direction. For mechanical waves, we can build a [[Polarizing Filter|polarizing filter]] or a polarizer that permits only waves of certain polarization direction to pass. Light can also be [[Polarization by reflection|polarized by reflection]].

The same concepts can be applied to electromagnetic waves,
We define the direction of polarization of an electromagnetic wave to be the direction of the electric-field $\vec{E}$  not the magnetic field $\vec{B}$. This is because many common electromagnetic wave detectors respond to the electric forces on electrons in materials, not the magnetic forces. Thus, the electromagnetic wave described by wave function:
$$\vec{E}(x, t) = \vec{j}E _{max}\cos(kx - \omega t)$$
$$\vec{B}(x, t) = \vec{k}B _{max}\cos(kx - \omega t)$$
is said to be polarized in the y-direction because the electric field only has a y-component.
