# Two-source interference of light:


This note is concerned with the double slit experiment:

## Two source interference of light:
A light source emits monochromatic light; however, this light is <u>not synchronized</u>. The light is directed to a narrow slit ($S _{0}$) which acts like an ideal source. (When a laser is used, this $S _{0}$ is not need because the light is already coherent).

The light from $S _{0}$ reaches the two slits $S _{1}$ and $S _{2}$ in-phase (as they are both equidistant away). Therefore, the light emerging from $S _{1}$ and $S _{2}$ are in-phase and form an interference pattern.

The path length difference is then given by $r _{2} - r _{1} = d \sin \theta$ , this is when we approximate the geometry so that $r _{1}$ and $r _{2}$ are parallel.

#### Constructive and Destructive Two-Slit interference:

Constructive: $d \sin \theta = m \lambda$ where m is the fringe number i.e. (m = $0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...$)

Destructive: $d\sin \theta = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$ where m is the fringe number again.

Where constructive interference happens there will be a bright fringe and where destructive interference happens there will be a dark fringe.

**For small angles of** $\theta$ we find that: $$y_{m} = R(\frac{m \lambda}{d}), \text{where m}=0, \pm 1, \pm 2$$ 
$y_{m}$ is the position of the m'th bright band

The separation of two adjacent fringes is then given by: $\Delta y = y_{m+1}-y_{m}$

We can find the [[Intensity of Interference Patterns (two source)]].
