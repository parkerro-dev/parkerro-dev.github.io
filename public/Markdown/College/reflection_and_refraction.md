# Reflection and Refraction
#college/physics/Light   

When light strikes a smooth interface sparating two transparent materials (such as air and glass), the wave is partly reflected and partly refracted(transmitted) into the second material.

We describe the direction of the reflected and refracted ray by the angle they make with the normal to the surface at the [[Point of Incidence|point of incidence]].

If the interface is rough the light (reflected and refracted) is scattered in various directions, so theres no single angle of transmission or angle of reflectance. When a interface is very smooth there is a definite angle of reflectance and we get _specular reflection_. (In optics this is the only reflectance we will be concerned with).

We can measure how refractive an interface is with the [[Refractive index]].

## Laws of Reflection and Refraction:
1. The incident, reflected, refracted rays and the normal all lie in the same plane. (__plane of incidence__)
2. The angle of reflection $\theta _{r}$ is equal to the angle of incidence $\theta_{i}$ for all wave lengths and any pair of materials. $$\text{Law of reflection: } \theta_{r} = \theta_{i}$$
3. For monochromatic light and for a given pair of materials a and b, on opposite sides of the interface, the ratio of the sines of the angles $\theta_{i}$ and $\theta_{t}$ (where i is incidence so material a and t is transmission or material b), where both angles are measured from the normal is equal to the inverse ratio of the two index of refraction. $$\text{Snell's Law (Law of refraction): } n_{a}\sin\theta_{i} = n_{b}\sin\theta_{t}$$ ![[Pasted image 20220406215840.png]]

If $n _{b} < n _{a}$  then [[Total Internal Reflection]] occurs.
