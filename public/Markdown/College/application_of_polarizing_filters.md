An ideal polarizer passes 100% of the incident light that is polarized parallel to the filter's polarizing axis, but completely blocks any light that is perpendicular to this axis. (this is not possible, but dream on <3)

An ideal polarizer like the one above lets **exactly half of the incident light's intensity**.
>[!Small note on Why]
>We can resolve the $\vec{E}$ field of the incident wave into a component parallel to the polarizing axis and a component perpendicular to it. Because the incident light is a random mixture of all states of polarization these two components are on average equal. (an ideal polarizer only transmits half the intensity of the incident ray.)  

## Adding a second polarizer:
If we add a second polarizer (analyzer) that makes an angle $\phi$ with the polarizing axis of the first polarizer, then the intensity of the light becomes impeded where it is greatest at $0 ^{o}$ and zero at $90^{o}$. To find the direction of polarization of the light transmitted by the first polarize rotate the analyzer until the photocell measures 0, then it is perpendicular to the first polarizer. The intensity is then described by Malus' Law.
