# Wave Equation:

One of the most important physics equations; as when it occurs we know that a disturbance can propagate as a wave along the x-positive axis with wave speed $\nu$. It doesn't have to be sinusoidal, any wave on a string obeys the equation and electric and magnetic fields satisfy the wave equation (where $\nu$ is c) which allows us to conclude light is an Electromagnetic wave.

### Equation:
So from the Wave Function, it was concluded that the acceleration of any particle in a transverse wave is:$$ a _{y} = \frac{\delta ^{2} y(x, t)}{\delta t^{2}} = -\omega^{2} A \cos(kx - \omega t) = -\omega ^{2}y(x,t)$$
The curvature of the string (second partial of x):  $$\frac{\delta ^{2} y(x, t)}{\delta x^{2}} = -k ^{2}y(x,t)$$
So if you divide one by the other you find: $$\frac{\frac{\delta ^{2} y(x, t)}{\delta t^{2}}}{\frac{\delta ^{2} y(x, t)}{\delta x^{2}}} = \frac{\omega ^{2}}{k^{2}} = \nu^{2}$$

The wave equation is defined as:
$$\frac{\delta ^{2} y(x, t)}{\delta x^{2}} = \frac{1}{\nu ^{2}}\frac{\delta ^{2} y(x, t)}{\delta t^{2}}$$
