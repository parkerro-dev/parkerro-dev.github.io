### My Website | 24/07/2022 
---
**Goals:**
- Create a portfolio website
- Use React and ChakraUI
- Do it in 72 Hours
- Deploy it on GitHub Pages

---

#### Summary:
The functionality of this website is built with the React Framework using React-Router for naviation, and ChakraUI for styling.


The project posts are rendered with React-Markdown, using remark and rehype plugins for Tex rendering (like this $\frac{\textrm{because markdown}}{\textrm{cannot do this}}$ by itself). 

The notes post for the College section use the same markdown rendering system, but they are all imported notes which I write in [Obsidian](http://www.obsidian.md) and maintain the "BackLink" functionality of Obsidian by using remark wiki-links and a react router Outlet.

### Details:

Before this project I had never built a JavaScript project which I was happy to release. However after teaching myself how to use JS and React, I made a couple "To-Do" apps and set out to make my own website. The hardest part of building a website for me, was deploying the website and making sure everything worked correctly. I am using GitHub Pages to host the website and using my custom domain. Although the website is quite simple, I learnt a lot of things from building it.

Before this project I had a limited knowledge of JavaScript, Git, Website Architecture, Frontend and Backend Development.

Now, I am confident in my frontend development skills in JavaScript and using Git for version control. I learnt alot about the difference between frontend and backend development and the link between them. As you can see from the source code, there is no backend for this website. All of the files are hosted in public file on Github. Why do it this way? I choose to go down this route as nothing on this website is not open source, or too nig to host. All of the files on this website are markdown files which are just a couple kilobytes. Plus as a student I don't have a cheap way for me to host my own backend.
