### My Website | 24/07/2022 
---
**Goals:**
- Create a portfolio website
- Use React and ChakraUI
- Do it in 72 Hours
- Deploy it on GitHub Pages

---

#### Summary:
The functionality of this website is built with the React Framework using React-Router for naviation, and ChakraUI for styling.


The project posts are rendered with React-Markdown, using remark and rehype plugins for Tex rendering (like this $\frac{\textrm{because markdown}}{\textrm{cannot do this}}$ by itself). 

The notes post for the College section use the same markdown rendering system, but they are all imported notes which I write in [Obsidian](http://www.obsidian.md) and maintain the "BackLink" functionality of Obsidian by using remark wiki-links and a react router Outlet.
